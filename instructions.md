# Assignment #8 (Final Project Implementation)  

This week's assignment is a continuation of the Final Project for the class, which should fulfill the requirements listed below.

## Part 1.

Start working on code for your final project, making use of *object-oriented programming* (OOP).  Your code should include at least one object `class` for the primary element in your program, such as the main player in a game.  It should also demonstrate programming the movement or other behaviors of the object(s) by using their *attributes* and *methods* with the "dot notation".

For example, an object in your program would likely include at least the `x` and `y` attributes for placement on the screen and methods to update and draw the object, like `update(self)` and `draw(self)`.  

## Part 2.  

Incorporate a sequence of secondary elements into your program as a List of objects.  For example, you may have other characters in a game, or objects that the primary player interacts with, or background animation elements (drops of rain or snow, stars in the sky, fish  in the sea, etc.)

Traverse the list you have created with a loop and draw each element in the sequence. You can draw the objects using images, p5 drawing functions, or a combination of both. 

Add animation and/or interaction to the objects in your program.  The interaction could include mouse or keyboard input (such as controlling the spaceship in Space Invaders game), and/or interaction between the primary and secondary elements (such as the spaceship shooting down the invaders).

## Part 3.  

Make use of the variable `program_state` to structure your program into at least 2 different states or behaviors.  For example, a game might have a "START" state, "PLAY" state, and "WIN"/"LOOSE" states.  

The initial state of your program can be a splash screen that incorporates on-screen text with the program title and your name. You can also use states to implement different levels of a game or any other aspect of a program. 

## Part 4. [Extra-credits]

Include and utilize a child object in your program that inherits some variables and methods from a parent object (use of *inheritance*), while overriding some methods with its own (use of *polymorphism*).  

Use original ideas and graphic assets as part of your program to the extent possible.  For example, add a description such as "original art by ..."  or something similar to your graphics or in code comments, to make it clear.  

In general, any additional effort and use of programming techniques beyond the project requirements can be considered extra credit.

The **due date for the project is on July 31st**, because Replit Teams for Education may be disabled starting on August 1st.

You will need to copy your code and assets to a new project outside of Replit Teams in order to view it after that date. I recommend that you use the following template link to create a new project outside of the HSCI-234-24SU team and under your own Replit account: https://replit.com/@artcenter/pyscript-p5-template

Please **be ready to present a functional demo of your final project during our last class**.
